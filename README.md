# Lab_Personnell_Gantt_Chart
A fork from Dr. Janet Hill's gantt chart. A really fantastic idea.

I moved from plotrix to ggplot2 to take advantage of additional customization options. I also chose to import from a csv as I find inputting data to be a little friendlier in excel. 
If you want to stay entirely in R, Dr. Hill's approach and other forks have clever ways of rapidly assembling the data.

A template for the csv is provided "Trainees and Staff.csv".

Sample image of trainees and staff that I have officially either supervised or co-supervised during my academic journey. I stared teaching courses as an instructor at McMaster in 2017 and thereafter co-supervised undergraduate trainees. There is personnel in the  Jordana/Koenig lab that do not appear here because I don't have start and end dates for them as I did not directly supervise them.
