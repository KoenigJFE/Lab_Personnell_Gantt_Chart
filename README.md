# Lab_Personnell_Gantt_Chart
A fork from Dr. Susan Hill's gantt chart. A really fantastic idea.

I moved from plotrix to ggplot2 to take advantage of additional customization options. I also chose to import from a csv as I find inputting data to be a little friendlier in excel. 
If you want to stay entirely in R, Dr. Hill's approach and other forks have clever ways of rapidly assembling the data.

A template for the csv is provided "Trainees and Staff.csv".
